Load Impact distributes .deb and .rpm packages for Linux systems and a Windows installation package. Linux packages are distributed by the packagecloud.io service. Linux installation requires Python v2.6 or v2.7 installed on your server.

Install the **psutil** dependency
```
$ sudo yum install epel-release
$ sudo yum install python-psutil
```
Packagecloud.io provides a setup script that manages .deb package installation including https-transport setup, setting PGP verification keys and adding a system .list file. You can see details here. So quick way is to download and run this script. Alternatively you can run the commands manually by following the instructions in the "manual" tab.
```
wget https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/loadimpact/server-metrics-agent/script.rpm.sh
sudo bash script.rpm.sh
```
Install last version of the package
```
sudo yum install li-metrics-agent
```
Run the configuration tool. You will be asked to give the agent a name and your server metrics token. The name is used for identification in the Load Impact application so it is recommended to choose a short readable name. The name and token will be written to the `config-file`. You can read about advanced configuration of Nagios and custom metrics plugins here.
```
$ sudo li-metrics-agent-config
```
You can also press the "Check installation" button on the https://app.loadimpact.com/monitoring/load-impact page. If a new entry appears in the list then the agent has been successfully installed.



If something goes wrong it's recommended you check the .log file:
```
$ tail /var/log/li_metrics_agent.log
```
You can manage the agent as a regular Linux service
```
# Upstart systems (Centos 6)
sudo initctl status|stop|start|restart li_metrics_agent

# Systemd systems (Centos 7)
sudo systemctl status|stop|start|restart li_metrics_agent.service
```
