#### Requesting a single resource

The simplest possible behavior for the client is to issue a HTTP request for a just one single resource (URL) on your site. Lets try it out:

```
 http.request_batch({
     {"GET", "http://test.loadimpact.com/"}
 })
```

That’s it. Each client will issue a single GET request, via `http.request_batch()`, to the given URL every time it executes the load script. In the example the URL is `http://test.loadimpact.com`, you should of course replace it with an URL that accesses your site.

***

#### Using HTTPS

Note that you may use either HTTP or HTTPS when fetching resources. To use HTTPS you just change the URL so it starts with `https://`:

```
 http.request_batch({
     {"GET", "https://test.loadimpact.com/"}
 })
 ```

***

#### GET request parameters

If you need to pass GET request parameters, just add them to the URL string:

```
http.request_batch({
     {"GET", "http://test.loadimpact.com/pi.php?decimals=18"}
 })
 ```

 ***

#### POST requests

To pass POST data, use the `POST` method and supply the post data using the data parameter.

```
http.request_batch({
     {"POST", "http://test.loadimpact.com/login.php", data="login=test_user&password=1234"}
 })
 ```

#### Load-test multiple resources

Your website visitors might commonly visit more than one page on your site. This means that load testing a single page is not going to be a very realistic load test. To create a more realistic “user scenario”, we want our load test to simulate the behavior of our site visitors, i.e. load multiple pages.

(Note to the advanced reader: we will simplify things a bit here, and pretend, that you’re only interested in loading the main HTML code for a page, without all the page dependencies)

Let’s try out a simple case first. Say, you notice that your users usually visit two URLs during a session: the news page and the page with contacts. You then have to fetch these two URLs in the client script:



```
http.request_batch({
     {“GET”, “http://test.loadimpact.com/news.php”}
 })
 http.request_batch({
     {“GET”, “http://test.loadimpact.com/contacts.php”}
 })
 ```
