Notifications allow you to subscribe to events happening in your organizations/projects. You can receive notifications to be aware when:
- A test has started.
- A test has completed.


You will likely want to use notifications when you schedule your performance tests and/or configure them into your Continuous Integration pipeline.

Load Impact supports three different notification options:
- Slack
- HipChat
- WebHook

**Note:** Notifications are configured per organization by the organization owner or an admin member.
