    <b>Deprecation of the Proxy Recorder - February 2019</b><br>
    Due to increased maintenance and lower overall utilization of our v3.0 Proxy Recorder we have decided to deprecate our proxy recorder. If you are currently using the proxy recorder, we suggest transitioning to v4.0.  v4.0 of Load Impact has the ability to convert HAR files to test scripts.  Existing proxy tools, such as <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a>, can be used to generate a HAR file.  We also have a <a href="https://github.com/loadimpact/FiddlerToLoadImpact">Fiddler to Load Impact</a> conversion tool available.

    For more information on converter HAR files to test scripts, refer to <a href="https://support.loadimpact.com/4.0/how-to-tutorials/how-to-convert-har-to-k6-test/">this article.</a> You may also upload your HAR file through our <a href="https://app.loadimpact.com/k6/tests/browser-recording">Web UI</a> to generate a script.
